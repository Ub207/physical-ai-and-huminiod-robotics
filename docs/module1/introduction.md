# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) serves as the nervous system for modern robotic platforms, providing the communication infrastructure, hardware abstraction, and tooling necessary for complex robotic applications. This module introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 and demonstrates how to build robust, distributed robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages and nodes
- Implement message passing and service architectures
- Design distributed robotic systems using ROS 2
- Integrate hardware components through ROS 2 drivers

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:
1. **ROS 2 Concepts**: Core architectural principles
2. **ROS 2 Architecture**: Components and communication patterns
3. **ROS 2 Packages**: Package management and structure
4. **ROS 2 Exercises**: Hands-on implementation tasks

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Linux command line
- Programming experience in Python or C++
- Familiarity with distributed systems concepts

## Introduction to ROS 2

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robotic software that provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robotic applications. It addresses the challenges of real-world robotic applications by providing:

- **Hardware Abstraction**: Interface with various sensors and actuators
- **Device Drivers**: Standardized interfaces for hardware components
- **Libraries**: Common functionality for perception, planning, and control
- **Visualization Tools**: Debugging and monitoring capabilities
- **Message Passing**: Communication between distributed components
- **Package Management**: Dependency management and build systems

ROS 2 builds upon the success of ROS 1 while addressing key limitations such as real-time support, security, and multi-robot systems.
