# Assessments Overview

The assessment framework for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course is designed to evaluate both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills. Assessments are structured to measure student progress across all learning objectives and modules.

## Assessment Philosophy

Our assessment approach emphasizes:
- **Application over Memorization**: Focus on practical implementation
- **Integration over Isolation**: Evaluate ability to combine concepts
- **Iteration over Perfection**: Emphasize learning through refinement
- **Collaboration over Competition**: Foster teamwork and knowledge sharing

## Assessment Structure

### Formative Assessments
- **Weekly Exercises**: Hands-on implementation tasks
- **Peer Reviews**: Collaborative learning and feedback
- **Progress Check-ins**: Regular milestone evaluations
- **Reflection Journals**: Self-assessment and learning logs

### Summative Assessments
- **Midterm Project**: Module-specific implementations
- **Final Capstone**: Comprehensive system integration
- **Technical Documentation**: Professional documentation standards
- **Demonstration**: Live system presentation

## Learning Objectives Alignment

Each assessment aligns with specific learning objectives:
