# Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**. This educational resource explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, focusing on how AI algorithms can be applied to physical systems and humanoid robots.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is designed to provide a complete educational journey from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations in physical AI. Each module builds upon the previous, culminating in a capstone project that demonstrates the integration of all concepts learned.

## Course Structure

The content is organized into four core modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of physical AI and humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Each module includes theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and hands-on exercises to reinforce learning.
