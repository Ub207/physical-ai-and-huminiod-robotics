## Prompt

website to chlao webste khali h

## Response snapshot

Modified sidebars.js to use autogeneration, which fixed the empty documentation section by dynamically creating the sidebar from the docs directory structure.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Resolved the user's issue of an "empty" website by correctly configuring the documentation sidebar to display all existing content.
- 🧪 Tests: Visual confirmation by the user that the website content now appears.
- 📁 Files: Modified huminiod-robotics/sidebars.js to use [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}].
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now proceed with editing their content.
- 🧠 Reflection: The user's description of an "empty" website was accurate from their perspective. Investigating the sidebar configuration was the key to understanding why the existing documentation files were not being rendered.
